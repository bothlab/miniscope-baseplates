# Baseplate Components for the UCLA Miniscope v4

This repository contains design file for baseplates and related components for the
[UCLA Miniscope v4](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4) which are based on and are compatible to the
original designs provided by the Miniscope project but have been re-drawn.

Modifications include small adjustments to make the parts easier to manufacture, as well as using an M1.6 cone-point set screw
that is easier to obtain and does not have to be specially made.

In addition to the updated baseplate this repository also contains design files for a lid to protect the GRIN lens while the
Miniscope is not attached.

All design files assume you are using the (slightly bigger) [baseplate variant 2](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/wiki/Parts-List#v4-base-plate)
with an objective module sleeve.

These files have been designed in collaboration with the mechanics workshop at Heidelberg University, Germany and are licensed
under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 (Strongly Reciprocal).
